        <h2> Understanding Fashion as a Hobby</h2>
        <p>
            Fashion has always been something part of my life. It often follows me
            everywhere I go. I believe it helps people express how they feel but without saying
            a word. It is a way you can present yourself and experiment with new looks everyday.
